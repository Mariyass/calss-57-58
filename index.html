        <p>The series is a mockumentary musical drama inspired by the “High School Musical” film series. The show stars Olivia Rodrigo, Joshua Bassett, Sofia Wylie, Kate Reinders, Matt Cornett and Frankie A. Rodriguez. Lucas Grabeel, an original star of the “High School Musical” movies, also appears. <br>Set at East High School, "High School Musical: The Musical: The Series" introduces members of the drama club and their faculty advisers as they work their way toward the opening night of the musicals that they produce. New romances blossom, old friendships are tested to their limits while new ones are formed, rivalries flare, and lives are changed forever as these students discover the transformative power that only high school theater can provide.
